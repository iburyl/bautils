### Common Call Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fc | Characteristic frequency - frequency at the right hand end of the portion of the call with the lowest absolute slope (the Body) |
| Sc | Characteristic Slope - slope of the body of the call |
| Fmax | Highest frequency recorded in the call |
| Fmin | Lowest frequency recorded in the call |
| Fmean | Mean frequency of the call, found by dividing area under the call by the duration |
| FME | Frequency of most energy (peak frequency) - frequency of the call with the greatest amplitude |
| S1 | Initial slope of the call |
| Tc | Time between the start of the call and the point at which Fc is measured |
| Fk | Frequency of the knee - where the body of a call starts, usually a point where dramatic change of slope occurs |
| Tk | Time from start of a call to the knee |
| Dur | Time from beginning of a call to its end |
| TBC/IPI | Time between calls (also called interpulse interval) |

#### Notes. 

Page 531:
> We measured a number of echolocation call variables. We used the frequency with the highest intensity as a
reference and determined higher and lower frequencies of calls at specific intensities below the peak (Fullard et al. 1993).
This eliminates the subjectivity involved in attempts to determine the minimum and maximum frequencies in a call,
which are often difficult to measure owing to background noise. For each call, we measured duration in milliseconds,
peak frequency in kilohertz (spectral peak of highest intensity), Low18 (lowest frequency, 18 dB below peak),
Low6 (lowest frequency, 6 dB below peak), High18 (highest frequency, 18 dB above peak), and High6 (highest frequency, 6 dB above peak).

1. "18 dB above peak" that is presumably to be read as "below peak" because everything beyond peak itself is below peak

2. I found 6 and 18 dB insufficient to consider measureing the whole calls. That probably depends on accuracy in measurents of the peak magnitude itself.
