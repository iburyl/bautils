Page 50. Table 4-1.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fc | Characteristic frequency - frequency at the right hand end of the portion of the call with the lowest absolute slope (the Body) |
| Sc | Characteristic Slope - slope of the body of the call |
| Fmax | Highest frequency recorded in the call |
| Fmin | Lowest frequency recorded in the call |
| Fmean | Mean frequency of the call, found by dividing area under the call by the duration |
| FME | Frequency of most energy (peak frequency) - frequency of the call with the greatest amplitude |
| S1 | Initial slope of the call |
| Tc | Time between the start of the call and the point at which Fc is measured |
| Fk | Frequency of the knee - where the body of a call starts, usually a point where dramatic change of slope occurs |
| Tk | Time from start of a call to the knee |
| Dur | Time from beginning of a call to its end |
| TBC/IPI | Time between calls (also called interpulse interval) |

### Echolocation Call Characteristics. Glossary

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| approach phase | shorter, more closely spaced calls that bats transition into to pursue and evaluate a target after detecting it from echoes gleaned from search phase calls |
| bandwidth | the total change in frequency through the call (kHz) |
| body | the section of the call from the knee to the characteristic frequency (ƒc) |
| dur | call duration (msec), from the beginning to the end of the call |
| ƒc | characteristic frequency, i.e., the frequency of the call at its lowest slope toward the end of the call, or the lowest frequency for consistent FM sweeps (kHz) |
| flat | a call or portion of a call with a very low slope or no slope (horizontal); low bandwidth |
| FM | frequency modulation, i.e., a change in frequency with time |
| ƒmaxE | the frequency (kHz) with the greatest amplitude (power, energy) |
| lo ƒ | lowest apparent frequency (kHz); an unreliable call descriptor as the distance to the bat strongly influences the observed value |
| harmonic | Higher frequency components of the same signal, appearing at integral multiples of the fundamental component (first harmonic) |
| hi ƒ | highest apparent frequency (kHz); an unreliable call descriptor as the distance to the bat strongly influences the observed value |
| inflection | a pronounced change in the slope of a call, sometimes called a “knee” |
| knee | a break in the downward FM sweep of a call with a discernable change in slope between the initial part and lower section of the call (body) leading to the characteristic frequency (ƒc) |
| lwr slp | lower slope, knee to ƒc slope (kHz/msec); the slope of the lower portion or body of the call from the knee to the ƒc (listed as KnToFcSlope on SonoBat output) |
| power | the amplitude or sound energy of a call or portions of a call |
| saturated | portion of a signal in which the amplitude of the signal exceeded the maximum recordable amplitude of the recording hardware, resulting in a flat-topped waveform; such a signal will not faithfully render the timeamplitude trend of a call, a useful feature for disambiguating some species |
| search phase | the (mostly) regularly spaced calls of (mostly) regular duration that bats use in routine flight to detect and avoid obstacles and search for prey |
| slp@ ƒc | slope at characteristic frequency, ƒc, (kHz) |
| sqnc, sequence | “bat pass;” a temporal series of calls from a passing bat; begins with the bat entering the detection volume of the microphone and ends with the bat leaving the detection volume |
| squiggle | an S-shaped variation in frequency (per time) over a portion of the call |
| tail, aka toe | a downward turn in the call trend at the end of the call |
| total slp | total slope (kHz/msec); overall change in frequency per change in msec (time) from the start of the call to the end of the call |
| uppr slp | upper slope, hi ƒc to knee slope (kHz/msec); the slope of the upper portion or onset of the call from the highest frequency at the start of the downward sweep to the knee (listed as HiFtoKnSlope on SonoBat output) |

#### Notes. 

Page 15 in Einglish translation:

> The term slope means the amount of the slope (regardless of whether the call increases or
decreases). To calculate the slope, the spectral bandwidth (frequency range: highest minus lowest
frequency) is divided by the duration of the relevant call segment, or the entire call.
> 
> - cf section: slope < 0.1 kHz/ms
> - qcf section: slope >= 0.1 and < 1 kHz/ms
> - FM section: slope >= 1 kHz/ms
> - cf call: average slope of the call < 0.1 kHz / ms
> - qcf call: average slope of the entire call is >= 0.1 and <1 kHz/ms
> - fm-qcf call: the call contains fm and qcf sections, each of which is at least 1 ms long. The average slope of the entire call must be >= 1 kHz, otherwise it is still a qcf call
> - fm call: the call does not contain any sections over 1 ms in length, the slope of which is < 1 kHz/ms

#### Notes. 

Page 531:
> We measured a number of echolocation call variables. We used the frequency with the highest intensity as a
reference and determined higher and lower frequencies of calls at specific intensities below the peak (Fullard et al. 1993).
This eliminates the subjectivity involved in attempts to determine the minimum and maximum frequencies in a call,
which are often difficult to measure owing to background noise. For each call, we measured duration in milliseconds,
peak frequency in kilohertz (spectral peak of highest intensity), Low18 (lowest frequency, 18 dB below peak),
Low6 (lowest frequency, 6 dB below peak), High18 (highest frequency, 18 dB above peak), and High6 (highest frequency, 6 dB above peak).

1. "18 dB above peak" that is presumably to be read as "below peak" because everything beyond peak itself is below peak

2. I found 6 and 18 dB insufficient to consider measureing the whole calls. That probably depends on accuracy in measurents of the peak magnitude itself.
